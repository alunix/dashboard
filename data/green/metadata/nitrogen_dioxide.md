The annual mean concentration of Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) is measured in microgrammes per cubic metre of air (µg/m<sup>3</sup>). 

There are two air quality objectives for NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in England:

- 40 µg/m<sup>3</sup> (annual mean)
- 200 µg/m<sup>3</sup> not to be exceeded more than 18 times a year (1-hour mean)
