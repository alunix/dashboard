The annual mean concentration of Particulate Matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) is measured in microgrammes per cubic metre of air (µg/m<sup>3</sup>). 

There are two air quality objectives for PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations in England:

- 40 µg/m<sup>3</sup> (annual mean)
- 50 µg/m<sup>3</sup> not to be exceeded more than 35 times a year (24-hour mean)
