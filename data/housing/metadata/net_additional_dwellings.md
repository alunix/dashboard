Net additional dwellings report the absolute increase in housing stock between one year and the next. It includes offices being converted into residential flats and subtracts buildings that have been demolished.

The chart shows the housing supply for each year as an index. The index starts in 2007-08 at an index number of 100. Subsequent changes in net additional dwellings are represented as percentage differences from that base year. For example, an index number of 85 means a 15% fall.
